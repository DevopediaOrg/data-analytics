# Overview
This project takes Olympics data and does analytics on the same. Open data has been used. Sources of data and important annotations are noted in this Readme file.

In its current state, only data from Rio 2016 has been used. The focus of analysis is on India's participation but we also include general analysis in some cases.


# Data Sources

* ``data/iso.country.codes.csv`` is obtained from [CountryCode.org](https://countrycode.org/). These contain the ISO country codes.

* ``data/rio2016/allCountries.Guardian.csv`` is obtained from [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full). Dropdown menu on this page gives a list of countries that took part in the games. Note that the country codes used here are not in line with the ISO codes.

This lists names of all sports played at the games. This tallies with data obtained from Rio 2016 website, except that "Artistic/Rhythmic/Trampoline Gymnastics" is written as "Gymnastics Artistic/Rhythmic/Trampoline".

* ``data/rio2016/allSports.Olympics.csv`` is obtained from [Rio 2016](https://www.rio2016.com/en/sports). This lists names of all sports played at the games.

* ``medals.ALG.html`` gives medals won by participants from country ALG. This data was obtained by scraping from the Guardian via this URL ``https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/olympics-2016/ubuntu/countries/medals/countryMedals-ALG.html``. Likewise are files for other countries that won medals. Countries that did not win any medal don't have a corresponding file.
